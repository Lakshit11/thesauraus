The application simply works as a dictionary where words can be searched and there respective meaning will be given as output. The modules used in the application are json, and a function called get_close_matches from the module difflib
The application is also capable to check mispelled words and suggest the closest matching word (for eg rainn, the application would ask do you mean rain?)
